Accessing Your Cluster
----------------------

Clusters used for the **Hands on Labs** run within the Nuanix Hosted POC environment, hosted in the Nutanix PHX and RTP datacenters.

To ensure a consistent and manageable experience for all lab attendees, today's lab sessions will be using Nutanix Frame.  This allows us to run full desktops and applications within a browser session and without the need to install any software on your local laptops.

Labs
....

There are 3 labs listed in the index to the left.  They are provided for later reference only and are not explicitly required for labs run within Nutanix Frame.  They have been left in place for those that may wish to set up dedicated Linux or Windows test/development VMs later.
